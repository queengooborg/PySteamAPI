> INSTRUCTIONS

1. First, you must have a Steamworks account set up at https://partner.steamgames.com/
2. Download the SDK somewhere on your drive
3. Change the include_dirs and library_dirs to link to the API's "/public" and "/redistributable_bin/COMPUTER_OS", respectively
4. Make sure that the library is somewhere your dynamic linker can find it -- this might mean setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac, or ??? on Windows
5. Run!
